PHP Inspired by Node Express

The world probably doesn't need another PHP framework, but I needed one.
Truth be told, I like PHP for what it is and I really don't believe we need that much on top of it.
The minimalist nature of [Express for Node.js](http://expressjs.com/) was my inspiration here, but this is not a port of Express *(which would really make no sense at all)*.

PHP Inspired by Node Express

The world probably doesn't need another PHP framework, but I needed one.
Truth be told, I like PHP for what it is and I really don't believe we need that much on top of it.
The minimalist nature of [Express for Node.js](http://expressjs.com/) was my inspiration here, but this is not a port of Express *(which would really make no sense at all)*.
I discovered [koa](http://koajs.com/), an evolution of Express, part way through this project, and liked the more concise
nature of the framework. 
A more appropriate name might be "PHP inspired by Node Express first and then Koa", but I liked
the name *pine* and stuck with it.

Pine is just getting started, but it's here for comment or contribution if people are interested.
